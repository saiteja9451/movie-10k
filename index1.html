    <h4>he name Hyderabad means "Haydar's City" or "Lion City", from haydar 'lion' and ābād 'city', after Caliph Ali Ibn Abi Talib, also known as Haydar because of his lion-like valour in battle.[6]

        The city was originally called Baghnagar ("city of gardens"[7]), and later acquired the name Hyderabad.[7][8] The European travellers von Poser and Thévenot found both names in use in the 17th century.[9][10][11]: 6 
        
        One popular legend suggests that the founder of the city, Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, named it Bhagya-nagar ("fortunate city"[12]) after Bhagmati, a local nautch (dancing) girl whom he married. She converted to Islam and adopted the title Hyder Mahal. The city would have been named Hyderabad in her honour.[11]: 6 [13]</h4>
