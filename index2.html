        Hyderabad is 1,566 km (973 mi) south of Delhi, 699 km (434 mi) southeast of Mumbai, and 570 km (350 mi) north of Bangalore by road.[57] It is situated in the southern part of Telangana in southeastern India,[58] along the banks of the Musi River, a tributary of Krishna River located on the Deccan Plateau in the northern part of South India.[59][60][61] Greater Hyderabad covers 650 km2 (250 sq mi), making it one of the largest metropolitan areas in India.[62] With an average altitude of 542 m (1,778 ft), Hyderabad lies on predominantly sloping terrain of grey and pink granite, dotted with small hills, the highest being Banjara Hills at 672 m (2,205 ft).[61][63] The city has numerous lakes sometime referred to as sagar, meaning "sea". Examples include artificial lakes created by dams on the Musi, such as Hussain Sagar (built in 1562 near the city centre), Osman Sagar and Himayat Sagar.[61][64] As of 1996, the city had 140 lakes and 834 water tanks (ponds).[65]
